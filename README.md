# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal LeetCode solutions, focused on clear reasoning, clean code, and algorithmic tradeoffs. Each entry includes my explanation, time/space complexity analysis, and any alternative approaches considered.

## Goals
- Document my problem-solving process
- Practice data structures and algorithms consistently
- Write clear, maintainable code
- Track progress over time

## Structure
Solutions are organized by topic and difficulty for easy navigation.  
See the folder structure below for details.

## How to Use This Repo
- Browse by category (e.g., arrays, dynamic programming)
- Read explanations in each problem’s folder
- Compare multiple approaches where included

## Languages
This repo primarily uses **Java**.  
Other languages may appear as I explore different approaches.

## Running Code
Each folder includes the solution and, when applicable, simple test cases.  
Feel free to clone and run using your preferred setup.

## Folders Overview
- `arrays/`, `graphs/`, etc. — problem-category folders  
- Each problem folder includes:
  - Problem statement summary
  - Solution code
  - Explanation (my thought process)
  - Complexity analysis

## Notes
This repository is not intended to provide the “best” or most optimized solutions, but rather to document my thinking and growth as a developer.
